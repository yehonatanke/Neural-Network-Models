# Neural Network Models 

This repository contains implementations of various neural network models using TensorFlow/Keras for different tasks.

## Models Included:

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model:**
   - File: `cnn_model.py`
   - Description: Implementation of a CNN model for image classification tasks.
   - How it Works: 
     - CNNs are specialized neural networks designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. They consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
     - Convolutional layers apply convolution operations to the input image, using filters to extract features such as edges and textures.
     - Pooling layers downsample the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers, reducing the spatial dimensions of the data.
     - Fully connected layers process the features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers, producing the final output for classification or regression.
     - CNNs use backpropagation and gradient descent during training to learn the optimal filter weights for feature extraction.

2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model (Using LSTM):**
   - File: `rnn_model.py`
   - Description: Implementation of an RNN model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells for sequence data tasks.
   - How it Works:
     - RNNs are designed to process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps.
     - LSTM cells are a type of RNN cell that address the vanishing gradient problem by introducing gates to regulate the flow of information.
     - Each LSTM cell contains a cell state and three gates (input, forget, and output gates) that control the flow of information.
     - The input gate decides which information to update in the cell state.
     - The forget gate decides which information to forget from the cell state.
     - The output gate decides which information to output from the cell state.
     - RNNs with LSTM cells are well-suited for tasks such as sequence prediction, language modeling, and machine translation.

3. **Transformer Model:**
   - File: `transformer_model.py`
   - Description: Implementation of a Transformer model for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
   - How it Works:
     - Transformers are a type of neural network architecture introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al.
     - Unlike traditional sequential models like RNNs, transformers process entire sequences in parallel, making them more efficient for long-range dependencies.
     - Transformers rely on self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different elements in the input sequence.
     - Each layer of the transformer contains multiple self-attention heads, allowing the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
     - The transformer encoder processes the input sequence, while the transformer decoder generates the output sequence.
     - Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.
