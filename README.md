# Neural Network Models 

This repository contains implementations of various neural network models using TensorFlow/Keras for different tasks.

## Models Included:

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model:**
   - File: `cnn_model.py`
   - Description: Implementation of a CNN model for image classification tasks.
   - General Description: 
     - CNNs are specialized neural networks designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. They consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
     - Convolutional layers apply convolution operations to the input image, using filters to extract features such as edges and textures.
     - Pooling layers downsample the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers, reducing the spatial dimensions of the data.
     - Fully connected layers process the features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers, producing the final output for classification or regression.
     - CNNs use backpropagation and gradient descent during training to learn the optimal filter weights for feature extraction.

   - How it Works:
     - CNNs use convolutional layers to apply convolution operations to the input image. 
     - Let $I$ be the input image with dimensions $W \times H \times C$, where $W$ is the width, $H$ is the height, and $C$ is the number of channels.
     - A convolutional layer applies a set of filters $F$ to the input image to produce feature maps $M$.
     - Each filter $f_i$ has weights $W_i$ and a bias $b_i$.
     - The output feature map $M_i$ for each filter is computed by convolving the filter with the input image and adding the bias: 
       $M_i = f_i * I + b_i$
     - Pooling layers downsample the feature maps by applying operations such as max pooling or average pooling.
     - Fully connected layers process the flattened feature maps to produce the final output for classification or regression.


2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model (Using LSTM):**
   - File: `rnn_model.py`
   - Description: Implementation of an RNN model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells for sequence data tasks.
   - General Description: 
     - RNNs are designed to process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps.
     - LSTM cells are a type of RNN cell that address the vanishing gradient problem by introducing gates to regulate the flow of information.
     - Each LSTM cell contains a cell state and three gates (input, forget, and output gates) that control the flow of information.
     - The input gate decides which information to update in the cell state.
     - The forget gate decides which information to forget from the cell state.
     - The output gate decides which information to output from the cell state.
     - RNNs with LSTM cells are well-suited for tasks such as sequence prediction, language modeling, and machine translation.

   - How it Works:
     - Let $X_t$ be the input at time step $t$, $H_t$ be the hidden state at time step $t$, and $C_t$ be the cell state at time step $t$.
     - LSTM cells have three gates: input gate $i_t$, forget gate $f_t$, and output gate $o_t$.
     - Each gate computes an activation $a$ and a gate output $g$ using the input $X_t$ and the previous hidden state $H_{t-1}$:
       $a_t = \sigma(W_{a} \cdot [H_{t-1}, X_t] + b_a)$
       $g_t = \sigma(W_{g} \cdot [H_{t-1}, X_t] + b_g)$
     - The input gate $i_t$ controls the flow of new information into the cell state:
       $i_t = \sigma(W_{i} \cdot [H_{t-1}, X_t] + b_i)$
     - The forget gate $f_t$ controls the flow of information to be discarded from the cell state:
       $f_t = \sigma(W_{f} \cdot [H_{t-1}, X_t] + b_f)$
     - The cell state $C_t$ is updated using the input gate and the forget gate:
       $C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * g_t$
     - The output gate $o_t$ controls the flow of information from the cell state to the hidden state:
       $o_t = \sigma(W_{o} \cdot [H_{t-1}, X_t] + b_o)$
     - The hidden state $H_t$ is computed using the output gate and the cell state:
       $H_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)$


4. **Transformer Model:**
   - File: `transformer_model.py`
   - Description: Implementation of a Transformer model for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
   - General Description:
     - Transformers are a type of neural network architecture introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al.
     - Unlike traditional sequential models like RNNs, transformers process entire sequences in parallel, making them more efficient for long-range dependencies.
     - Transformers rely on self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different elements in the input sequence.
     - Each layer of the transformer contains multiple self-attention heads, allowing the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
     - The transformer encoder processes the input sequence, while the transformer decoder generates the output sequence.
     - Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.

   - How it Works:
     - Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences.
     - Let $X$ be the input sequence with embeddings $E$, and $W$ be the weight matrices for the transformer layers.
     - Self-attention computes attention scores $A$ between all pairs of elements in the input sequence:
       $A = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})$
     - The attention scores are used to compute weighted sums of the input sequence:
       $V = A \cdot V$
     - Multi-head attention computes multiple attention heads in parallel:
       $MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O$
     - Position-wise feedforward networks apply fully connected layers to each position separately.
     - Layer normalization and residual connections are applied after each sub-layer to stabilize training.
     - Transformers use encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder processes the input sequence and the decoder generates the output sequence.
